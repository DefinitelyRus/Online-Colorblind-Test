# Online-Colorblind-Test

	PROJECT: COLOR BLIND TEST

2.	DESCRIPTIONS:
A simple Color-Blind Test is developed in this project. As its name suggests, it is a test to show whether the audience is Colorblind or not. Webpage is fully responsive thanks to Bootstrap. The test is made up of an initial total of 12 questions which increases by 6 if user gets 2 questions correct from the initial 12.
Each question is composed of an image that looks different to colorblind people. The user types their answers in the blank and clicks the submit button to proceed. After clicking the button, the textbox below then changes according to what the user answered. After the user finishes answering all questions, he then meets the end screen with a changing monologue depending on whether the user answered correctly or not, with a button on screen.

3.	HOW TO NAVIGATE ON THE WEB PAGES or USE/RUN THE PROGRAM: [sample only] 
This projectâ€™s goal is to check whether the user is colorblind or not based on a certain set of questions. The project starts with the Home screen showing the title page and a button. The button then leads to the start of the test, the Questions screen composed of the title, an img, a blank form, a button, and a textbox with instructions. The Questions screen is initially composed of 12 questions, which is increased by 6 depending on whether the user gets 2 questions correct from the initial 12 questions. Each question contains an img that appears differently to colorblind people. The user types their answers in the blank, and proceeds by clicking the button. After clicking the button, the textbox below the form and button changes dependent on the users answers. After finishing all questions, the user is led to the end screen showing the title, a monologue that changes dependent on whether the user answered correctly or not, and a button labeled Finish.
