# Online Colorblind Test

As its name suggests, it is a test to show whether the user is color blind or not... with a humorous twist. The test starts with the Home screen showing the title page and a gorgeous green button. Pressing the button leads to the start of the test, the question screen composed of the title, an img, a blank form, a button, and a text input box with instructions.

The test is composed of 12 questions and an additional 6 for confirmation if the user gets at least 2 questions wrong. Each question is composed of an image that may look different to colorblind people. The user types their answers in the blank and clicks the submit button to proceed. After the user finishes answering all questions, the user then reaches the end screen with a changing dialogue depending on whether the user answered correctly or not, with a button on screen to finish the test. ;)

## How to use
1. Press start to begin.
2. Read the questions and type your answer into the text input box.
3. Press submit to proceed to the next question.
4. After finishing all questions, press finish to end the test.
