# Online Colorblind Test

As its name suggests, it is a test to show whether the user is color blind or not. The test is made up of an initial total of 12 questions which increases by 6 if user gets 2 questions correct from the initial 12. The test starts with the Home screen showing the title page and a button. The button then leads to the start of the test, the Questions screen composed of the title, an img, a blank form, a button, and a text input box with instructions.

Each question is composed of an image that may look different to colorblind people. The user types their answers in the blank and clicks the submit button to proceed. After clicking the button, the textbox below then changes according to what the user answered. After the user finishes answering all questions, the user then meets the end screen with a changing dialogue depending on whether the user answered correctly or not, with a button on screen to finish the test.
